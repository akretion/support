Usage
=====

Testing Tips
=============

For running the test as the module project_api and project_api_client
interact together. A mock have been design based on request-mock and
a json file

If you run the test in "learning mode"

LEARN=True odoo -u project_api_client,project_api --test-enable --stop-after-init

Odoo will update the data.json file automatically

Then you can run it in real testing mode by removing the LEARN=True var
